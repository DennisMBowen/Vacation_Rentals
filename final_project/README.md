# Vacation Rental Management System

This is a React application that provides a front end to the Vacation Rental Management System database. The Vacation Rental Management System provides property managers an easy way to keep track of their property data. It will store information about guests, properties, reservations, and invoices.

This web application is based largely on the sample React application that is demonstrated by Professor Michael Curry throughout CS 340. Features that are based on the sample React application include routing, layout, styling, and deployment.
